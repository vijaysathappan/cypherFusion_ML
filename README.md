PolyBoost Machine Learning Algorithm
This article introduces PolyBoost ML, a custom ensemble learning algorithm with the power of multiple decision trees to achieve high accuracy and robustness. It is crafted to tackle the most daunting challenges of high-dimensional datasets, missing values, high cardinality categorical features, and overfitting, which often trip up traditional models. Our model has polynomial feature extraction to uncoverintricate relationships between features, significantly boosting the model's predictive capabilities. What sets ML apart is its innovative approach oftraining multiple decision trees on various data subsets and merging theirpredictions to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting. This strategy ensuresthat the model generalizes well to new data, unlike many conventional modelsthat perform well on training data but stumble on unseen data. Initial testsreveal that ML substantially outperforms these traditional models in terms ofmean squared error (MSE) and R² score, highlighting its robust predictive powerand reliability. This advanced method not only handles data more effectively butalso transforms our approach to complex data analysis, offering a robust andefficient solution that represents a significant leap forward in machinelearning.  By integrating innovative data preprocessing, polynomial feature extraction, and a custom ensemble modeling technique, this algorithm overcomes common hurdles and delivers outstanding results, marking a major advancement in the field of machine learning.
